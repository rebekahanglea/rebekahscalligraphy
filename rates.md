# My rates

The calculator below will give you an idea of how much I charge for calligraphy.

My prices favor commissions with low word counts (typically short phrases) written in black ink on white paper. But feel free to play around with the calculator, and when you've found an estimate to your liking, reach out to me with the details and we'll get your project started.

Please remember, this price is just an **estimate**. But unless you have something truly unusual in mind, this should be a fairly accurate estimate. I'm not really into throwing curveballs. :)

If you'd like to commission your piece, please contact me and we'll get this conversation started! 

And as always, please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions. I'm glad to help. 

Looking forward to working with you!
